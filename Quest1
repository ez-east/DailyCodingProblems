# Daily coding problem 1
# Given by Google
# Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.
#
# For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.
#
# Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?

# example test cases
testset = [17, 2, 4, 14, 15, 16, 3, 10, 11, 12, 13, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
testk = 21


# function

def findk(l, target_number):
    s = set()
    for number in l:
        print "before", number, " ", target_number - number, " ", s
        if target_number - number in s:
            return True
        s.add(number)
        print "after", number, " ", target_number - number, " ", s
    return False

#run
findk(testset, testk)
